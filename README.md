# openspec-mod

A small set of tweaks to the files generated by the official `openspec init` template, to better match my personal workflow.

## What it changes

- Adds an `implementation.md` plan after the proposal stage.
  - The goal is to provide a more detailed, step-by-step modification plan so users can clearly see what the model will do next.

## How to use

1. Run `openspec init` in your project.
2. Download/clone this repo.
3. Copy the contents of this repo over the files generated by `openspec init` (overwrite existing files).

## Notes

- This repo is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for the default instruction files created by `openspec init`.
- Slash commands are currently tuned for RooCode/GitHub Copilot/OpenCode, but the commands themselves are generic and can be adapted to other tools with simple copy/paste.
